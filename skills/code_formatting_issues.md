# Code Formatting Issues

Sometimes the code that is output by the artificial intelligence system is not formatted in such a way that it looks like code on the screen

Sometimes it just looks like plain text and it's very hard to copy paste. We want to make sure that anytime code is output to the screen that it is very easy to copy and paste using the copy and paste button and the code formatting that should be included with the output that is an important part. We wanna make sure that doesn't get missed because it slows down the flow.

It is also a thing that causes extra prompts and I know that nobody wants extra props and so we should just make sure that's not a problem. We should make sure that everything is formatted in a way that it looks like code and then it's copy paste and easy to understand no more code formatting issues, please
