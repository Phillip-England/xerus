# Code, Tests, and Examples

It is very important to me that my code stays in sync with my tests and my examples so I need to make sure that's a top priority, especially my tests

We need to always be checking our test to make sure that they are up-to-date and we always need to be thinking about adding new test. Make sure the system is as refined as possible because when changes are made, we need to make sure that the system doesn't break when changes are made.

The only way that we can do that is by making sure that the system and the tests are in sync so I wanna make changes to the code. We need to make sure that we make changes to the test so when you make sure that we add New test, reinforce the code.

The same thing with our examples are examples. It should be an alignment with the most modern way to use the system, even though there may be deprecated parts of the system. Our example should be in sync and make sure they show users the most modern way to do things.
